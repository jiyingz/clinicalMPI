Description: This R package implements the novel modified probability interval (mPI) phase I clinical trial design. The mPI design is intended to find the maximum utility 
    dose out of a provided selection. It is useful for treatments where both too low and too high efficacy are actively dangerous to patients, for example in organ transplant 
    mixed-chimerism radiation therapy. This design uses a Bayesian interval-based model to make decisions. It is advantageous in that it does not depend on arbitrary 
    physician-elicited input to make decisions and is flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen parameter or sample size changes during a trial.
